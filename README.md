This is My First Git Repository
Author: Shahanaj Shaikh<br>

Decription:
SkillLink is a location-based workforce matching platform designed to bridge the gap between skilled workers (like electricians, tailors, plumbers, carpenters, etc.) and customers who need their services. It helps skilled individuals find job opportunities in their vicinity, while providing users with access to reliable and verified professionals.

Project Description:
Many skilled workers face difficulty in finding job opportunities near them, while customers struggle to find trustworthy service providers. SkillLink solves this issue by providing:

-A web platform that connects workers and customers based on location, availability, and service category.
-Two types of user accounts: Employee (worker) and Customer.
-Easy-to-use interface for browsing services, contacting workers, and registering accounts.
